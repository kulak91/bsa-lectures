    <strong>Hi, student!</strong> ðŸ‘‹
    <br />
    Here you'll find a detailed instruction to your Git homework - so you just
    need to follow the steps and it's done âœ…. But firstly, pay attention to
    that:
    <ol className="compact inverted">
      <li>
        this is <strong>not</strong> a lecture script - some explanations may be
        omitted <em>(because you've just seen the lecture, right?)</em>;
      </li>
      <li>
        I highly recommend you to look throught all the tasks before you start your homework.
        Pay attention, that <strong>you have only 3 attempt</strong> to run the automated test.
      </li>
      <li>
        links to the documentations and guidelines are optional{" "}
        <em>(you may ignore them if you feel strong enough)</em>;
      </li>
      <li>
        please <strong>don't skip</strong> any steps and don't rename anything -
        we'll run automated test after you submit the homework and namings may
        be important!
      </li>
      <li>and if you have any questions - feel free to ask them in a chat</li>
    </ol>
    By the way, it's dangerous to go alone! Take this:{" "}
    <a href="https://git-scm.com/">
      <strong>Git</strong>
    </a>
    ,{" "}
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">
      <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>
    </a>
    . Now let's go!
