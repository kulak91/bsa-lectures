  The student is still on probation at his new company and is still using Slack to collaborate with other developers and communicate with customers. Ryu writes in the chat one warm spring evening - a former customer <em>(returning customer, ya-a-a-ay!)</em>, for whom an online resume was previously made. He is completely satisfied with the quality of our work and wants to entrust us with another project &mdash;

So, there is no specification, but it seems that this time we are talking about a "street fight" simulator - a game in which the player chooses two fighters, who in turn fight, slapping each other with their hands, feet, and head. Whoever runs out of lives first - loses. In fact, they do not die because they are virtual.

🤭Oh ... 🤔Or they die ... The customer didn’t provide any specific technical task, so we will make it ourselves. So is the design. Let it be just a browser game in the beginning, in which one character systematically beats another and vice versa, and a moderately complex algorithm determines how hard the blow was inflicted and how much life is left in the slow loser who did not have time to dodge to be elbowed in the nose. And then we'll see what new functionality or design you can manage to code before the deadline. Well, assure the client that everything is under control and to work?

  <strong>Yeah, sure, I'm on it, let's go!</strong> I'm gonna target modern browsers and will start with the plain JavaScript using new ES6 features where necessary. Sometime in the future, when the project evolves, we'll use libraries like React or Vue.js, but for now, vanilla JavaScript will do the job just fine.

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ready to try <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a>?</strong></p>
    <p>To start with, here are <strong>the main points</strong> you should remember about JS:</p>
    <p><span className="chip">Brendan Eich</span><span className="chip">EcmaScript</span><span className="chip">script language</span><span className="chip">dynamic language</span><span className="chip">weakly typed</span><span className="chip">first-class functions</span><span className="chip">object-oriented</span><span className="chip">prototype-based</span><span className="chip">single-threaded</span><span className="chip">asynchronous</span></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/code-comments-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-be9cc65fbf83">Putting comments in code</a></strong></p>
    <p>The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages. Comments behave like white space and are discarded during script execution.</p>
    <SnippetL01S01 />
    <SnippetL01S02 />
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Declaring block:</strong></p>
    <p>A <strong>block statement</strong> (or <strong>compound statement</strong> in other languages) is used to group zero or more statements. The <strong>block</strong> is delimited by a pair of braces:</p>
    <SnippetL01S03 />
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Declaring variables: <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code></strong>

    There are three kinds of declarations in JavaScript:

    <DetailsCard>
      <>
        <code>var</code> declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value
      </>
      <>
        Declaration will be hoisted to the global scope or a function block scope. Variable defined inside of the inner scope can override another variable from the outer scope. <strong>That's why it mustn't be used in the modern JS code!</strong>

        <SnippetL01S04 />
      </>
    </DetailsCard>

    <DetailsCard>
      <>
        <code>let</code> declares a local block-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value
      </>
      <>
        Declaration won't be hoisted but will create a new locally scoped variable.

        <SnippetL01S05 />
      </>
    </DetailsCard>


    <DetailsCard>
      <>
        <code>const</code> declares a local block-scoped read-only constant variable
      </>
      <>
        Variable cannot be <strong>reassigned</strong>, but objects defined with <code>const</code> can be changed

        <SnippetL01S06 />
      </>
    </DetailsCard>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Data Types</strong>

    According to the <strong>ECMAScript</strong>, there are seven primitive types and everything else is an <code>Object</code> type. Let’s run over those one by one:


    <DetailsCard>
      <>
        <strong>Boolean</strong>
      </>
      <>
        The boolean type has two values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.

        <SnippetL01S07 />
      </>
    </DetailsCard>


    <DetailsCard>
      <>
        <strong>Number</strong>
      </>
      <>
        An integer or floating point number.

        <SnippetL01S08 />

        <SnippetL01S09 />

        The number type has three symbolic values: `+Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` (not-a-number).

        <SnippetL01S10 />
      </>
    </DetailsCard>


    <DetailsCard>
      <>
        <strong>BigInt</strong> <em>(added in ES2020)</em>
      </>
      <>
        Represents who represent whole numbers larger than <code>2<sup>53</sup> - 1</code> which is larger than maximum value of <code>Number</code> type.

        <SnippetL01S26 />
      </>
    </DetailsCard>


    <DetailsCard>
      <>
        <strong>String</strong>
      </>
      <>
        A sequence of characters that represent a text value. JavaScript <strong>strings are immutable</strong>.

        <SnippetL01S11 />

        <SnippetL01S12 />
      </>
    </DetailsCard>

    <DetailsCard>
      <>
        <strong>Symbol</strong>
      </>
      <>
        A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an object property. So we can “covertly” hide something into objects
        that we need, but others should not see, using symbolic properties.

        <SnippetL01S15 />
      </>
    </DetailsCard>


    <DetailsCard>
      <>
        <strong>undefined</strong>
      </>
      <>
        <code>undefined</code> is a property of the global object. The initial value is the primitive value <code>undefined</code>

        <SnippetL01S14 />
      </>
    </DetailsCard>


    <DetailsCard>
      <>
        <strong>null</strong>
      </>
      <>
        <code>null</code> is a keyword denoting a special empty <em>(null)</em> value.

        <SnippetL01S13 />
      </>
    </DetailsCard>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/js-type-coercion-explained-27ba3d9a2839">Type coercion</a></strong>

    JavaScript variables can be converted to a new variable and another data type either by the use of a JavaScript function or automatically by JavaScript itself:

    Converting to <strong>string</strong>:

    <SnippetL01S16 />

    Converting to <strong>number</strong>:

    <SnippetL01S17 />

    Converting to <strong>boolean</strong>:

		<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects" title="Standard built-in objects"><strong>Standard built-in objects</strong></a>

    Objects, which are created in the global scope and can be accessed wherever in the code. They can be created by the user script or provided by the host environment <em>(browser, node)</em>. Let's look through the common ones:

    <DetailsCard>
      <>
        <strong>Object</strong>
      </>
      <>
        Represents complex Javascript data type. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex nested entities.

        <SnippetL01S34 />
      </>
    </DetailsCard>


    <DetailsCard>
      <>
        <strong>Array</strong>
      </>
      <>
        List-like object, which includes methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Each element can be accessed only by its index. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed.

        <SnippetL01S27 />
      </>

		<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions" title="Functions"><strong>Functions</strong></a>

    Function is a "subprogram" that can be called by code external (or internal in the case of the recursion) to the function. <br/>
    A function is composed of a sequence of statements called the <strong>function body</strong>. Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value. In JavaScript, functions are <strong>first-class objects</strong>, because they <strong>can have properties and methods</strong> just like any other object. <br/> There are three ways to declare function in Javascript:

    <DetailsCard>
      <>
        <strong>Function declaration</strong> - hoisted, has a context
      </>
      <>

    Let's learn more about the <strong>transpilers</strong> — tools that read source code written in one programming language, and produce the equivalent code in another language. The most popular one, <a href="https://babeljs.io/"><strong>Babel</strong></a>, is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Let's try it out:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"><strong>node.js</strong></a>, open <strong>Terminal</strong> in Visual Studio Code <sup><em>(Terminal</em> &rarr; <em>New Terminal)</em></sup>, and run <code>npm init</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now install <strong>babel</strong> with <code>npm i -D @babel/core @babel/cli</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add <code>"scripts"</code> to the <strong>package.json</strong> file
        <div>
          <SnippetL03S06 />
        </div>
        and run <code>npm run build</code> in the terminal to see if it works
      </li>
      <li>
        Set up transpiling of ES2015+ code — <code>npm install @babel/preset-env --save-dev</code>, create a <strong>.babelrc</strong> in the root of your project, with the following content:
        <div>
          <SnippetL03S07 />
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Let's watch for changes by running <code>babel</code> with <code>-w</code> flag
        <div>
          <SnippetL03S09 />
        </div>
      </li>

    Alright, let's <span style={{ textDecoration: 'line-through'}}><em>npm install everything</em></span> set up <a href="https://webpack.js.org/"><strong>Webpack</strong></a> — a module bundler for JavaScript applications:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Install Webpack by running <code>npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev</code>, then create a file named <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> in the root of your project, with the following content:

          <SnippetL03S12 />
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Set <code>build</code> command in <strong>package.json</strong>'s <code>scripts</code> key to <code>"build": "webpack"</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Set up <a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/" target="_blank"><strong>loaders</strong></a>:

        <DetailsCard>
          Add <code>babel-loader</code> to transpile code, as was mentioned before:

            <code>npm install babel-loader --save-dev</code> and edit <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> to include <code>module</code> key:

            Rename <strong>.babelrc</strong> to <strong>babel.config.js</strong> to consistent with webpack config type and change it's content to:

            <SnippetL03S14 />
          </>
        </DetailsCard>
        <DetailsCard>
          Add <code>style-loader</code> and <code>css-loader</code>, so that you could import styles in your JavaScript files with <code>import './src/styles/styles.css';</code>
          <>
            As usual, just run <code>npm install css-loader style-loader --save-dev</code> and edit <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> to include the new rules:
            <SnippetL03S15 />
          </>
        </DetailsCard>
      </li>

      <li>
        Set up <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/"><strong>plugins</strong></a>:


        <DetailsCard>
          Add <code>html-webpack-plugin</code> to automate HTML file creation:
          <>
            <code>npm install html-webpack-plugin --save-dev</code> and edit <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> to include <code>plugins</code> key:

            <SnippetL03S17 />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <DetailsCard isReversed>
                  Add <code>html-loader</code> to bundle assets from template <code>.html</code> file:
                  <>
                    <code>npm install html-loader --save-dev</code> and edit <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> to include the new rule:

                    <SnippetL03S18 />
                  </>
                </DetailsCard>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </>
        </DetailsCard>
      </li>

      <li>
        Add <a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/" target="_blank"><strong>Webpack DevServer</strong></a> — <code>npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev</code> and modify <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> to include <code>devServer</code> and <code>publicPath</code> keys:

        <SnippetL03S16 />

        Add <code>"dev": "webpack-dev-server"</code> to <strong>package.json</strong>'s <code>scripts</code> key
      </li>
      <li>
        Maybe add <code>devtool</code> option to the <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> for much better debugging experience — <code>devtool: "source-map"</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
