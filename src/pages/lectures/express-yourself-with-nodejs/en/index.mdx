    <strong>Hello!</strong><br />Remembering the days when I was a student, I tried not to overload the lecture with unnecessary and complicated information that will not be useful to you in the next couple of months. On the other hand, it is encouraged to understand the details, therefore, I will attach links to additional materials and articles. The lecture is divided into blocks that are as independent of each other as possible, so if, after reading a title, you understand you're already familiar with the content, feel free to move on to the next block.<br />Good luck!

  Ryu, being very happy with the online fighting game, started showing off to his friends. At first, the game caused incredible excitement, but before Ryu had a chance to begin negotiations with Capcom, the hype had subsided. Everyone noted that there are too few characters in the game and their characteristics do not correspond to reality, which is why it became boring to play.
  Frustrated, Ryu again asks the developers to fix the situation:

  <p>Hi, I need to increase the number of characters in the fighting game. I also want to be able to change the properties of the players, their appearance, damage, vulnerability and names (because among us there are French who are offended when their name is spelled incorrectly)</p>
</SlackMessage>

The student realized that a simple page begins to grow into a serious application with business logic and user management and at the same time they're not able to store large amounts of data on the client. So the student decides that it's time to develop the server!

  Yes, I think we can implement all this using a server.
</SlackMessage>

And since the student writes in JS, the choice for the technology becomes obvious - Node.js. There is only one little thing left ― <span className="tooltip" data-tooltip='well, yeah, "little thing"...'><u>to learn this technology</u></span>.

    <p>The modern web server performs many actions for processing and storing information, works with static files and sensitive data that no one should have access to, performs complicated calculations that are too heavy for the client side, and much more. Therefore, depending on the complexity of the project and the tasks to be solved, for convenient work and efficiency, the server would be built according to a certain architecture: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application"><strong>monolithic</strong></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices"><strong>microservice</strong></a>.</p>

To start the installation process, just go to the official website [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), and download the installation file for your operating system, then follow the instructions.

<div className="bubble small subtle">
  It would also be a very good idea to use a package called node version manager to manage the installation of different node versions on your system. There is an <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">nvm package for Mac and Linux</a> or a separate <a href="https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows">package for Windows</a>. Check one of those links and follow the instructions to install nvm on your system and that will give you the ability to install any version of Node.js you need.
</div>

There is no point in writing the full installation process for all operating systems, there are a lot of official tutorials for that, but I want to pay attention to the common installation problems.

Did you notice **npm**? But did we install it? It's a package manager developed by the Node.js team and installed altogether with Node for easy management of modules. We'll talk about it in more detail in the next block, but now it's important to make sure it works.

        _3. And what if your solution was longer and took 400 lines of code? 500 lines? 1000?_

        <div className="bubble small subtle">

          It is not so convenient to copy such amounts of data manually. 

        </div>

        _4. Therefore, it is better to format your function correctly and publish it to a remote storage._

        <div className="bubble small subtle">
          Now other programmers just need to know the name of your package / module and use **npm** to add it to their project, delete it if they don't like it, or upgrade to the next version if you implement it.
        </div>

        > One more time - what is the difference between `packages` and `modules`? Believe me, even experienced developers are often confused, but the difference is simple - `module` is an atom, `package` is a molecule. In other words, `package` consists of other `modules`, which are the smallest unit that solves one problem. Pretty simple, isn't it?

    [Several years ago](https://www.javascriptstuff.com/javascript-frontend-package-managers/) the block about package managers could have taken the whole lecture due to their variety, but today the situation has stabilized, and now to work with JS we have 2 leaders:

    All  **npm** packages are available in **yarn**, because they use the same data source. **yarn** was created only to improve the performance of **npm**. There is no actual difference between them, except for the subjective judgment of fans of a particular tool. In the future, you will have to decide on your own what is more convenient for you to work with, but today we will talk about **npm**, because of its relation with Node.js.

**Node.js** - is a **JavaScript** runtime, where we can run scripts. Everything will work <span className="tooltip" data-tooltip='"almost" because they only have V8 in common'><u>almost like in a browser</u></span>, so the transition from frontend to backend should be <span className="tooltip" data-tooltip='compared to learning a new language'><u>as comfortable as possible</u></span>.

To go to the environment you need to run the command `node` in the terminal, then run any JS code. But obviously, this method is not the most convenient one and it is better to write code in files, that can then be run with the command `node file_name.js`.  

Experiment time! We already know how to use all of JS 's power with Node and that's awesome, but now we want to start implementing servers. Let's open [an official documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/), to take a look at the list of built-in **Node.js** packages, and find out how to work with them. As we can see, there are too many of them, but we only need one to get started - [http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html), that is responsible for working via HTTP. After reading the description we understand that it has many methods and it doesn't make sense for a beginner to consider all of them, instead let's write a practical example of starting an HTTP server: 
<SnippetJS01 />

<div className="details">
  <input type="checkbox" id="accordion-4-1" />

    <strong>Run the file</strong>

  </div>
</div>

<div className="details">
  <input type="checkbox" id="accordion-4-2" />
  <label className="summary" htmlFor="accordion-4-2">
    <strong>Check the server via browser</strong>
  </label>
  <div className="details-body">

    The browser always sends a GET request to the specified URL and in addition requests _favicon.ico_, because it perceives any address as a page.

    <img src={get_serverImg} alt="get_server" />

    Server logs that we get from the `requestHandler()` function

    <img src={get_server_logImg} alt="get_server_log" />
  </div>
</div>

<div className="details">
  <input type="checkbox" id="accordion-4-3" />
  <label className="summary" htmlFor="accordion-4-3">
    <strong>Check the server via Postman</strong>
  </label>
  <div className="details-body">

    Meet [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) ― tool for convenient sending of HTTP-requests to a server. Via Postman we can easily change the URL, methods, headers, and body of requests.

    <img src={postmanImg} alt="postman" />
    <div className="bubble small subtle">

      ["Postman Introduction"](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
      
    </div>

  </div>
</div>

We created a working server! Hooray! It is very simple and does not understand the difference between GEt and POST requests, does not know how to work with request body and much more, but it is the first one and we ❤️ it just for that, right? Let's teach the server to save all logs to a file, and also try another package [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html), designed to work with the file system:
<SnippetJS02 />

<div className="details">
  <input type="checkbox" id="accordion-4-4" />
  <label className="summary" htmlFor="accordion-4-4">
    <strong>After sending a few requests, let's take a look at the file <i>log.txt</i></strong>
  </label>
  <div className="details-body">
    <img src={server_logsImg} alt="server_logs" />
  </div>
</div>

And what will happen if the writing to the file is not finished yet, and the server receives another request? Looking ahead, I will say that file system operations are asynchronous streams, and considering the single-threaded JS, they must block the server until completion. But this is not the case, and we can see this by bombarding the server with requests, and it will not cancel or delay any of them.
<div className="bubble small subtle">

    <strong>And why is that? Now we should finally understand how the eventloop is implemented in Node</strong>
  </label>
  <div className="details-body">
    The circle in the center is a JS thread and it always performs only one operation at a time. On the left we see a queue of requests waiting to be fulfilled. When a synchronous request is received, it starts to be processed and upon completion starts the next request. In cases where the request causes asynchronous operations, it is delegated to the library [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv), which processes it in a separate thread, and upon completion, puts the callback in the same queue.

Let's return to our code. It looks too cumbersome for the functionality it performs because it works with too [low-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language) operations. We will talk in the next block about how to move to a higher level of abstraction with Express.js.

**Express.js** is a package that provides many features that simplify developing **Node.js** applications. It increases the level of abstraction and we do not need to configure the network connection, parse headers, methods and query body, and more. To get started, let's install [it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) in a project using **npm**.
<SnippetShell03 />

Create a new file and write the code for a basic HTTP server:

<SnippetJS03 />

<div className="details">
  <input type="checkbox" id="accordion-5-1" />
  <label className="summary" htmlFor="accordion-5-1">
    <strong>Let's run the code and check if it works</strong>
  </label>
  <div className="details-body">

    <SnippetShell04 />

    <img src={express_getImg} alt="express_get" />
    <img src={express_postImg} alt="express_post" />
  </div>
</div>

Everything works! If we try to send requests to routes that aren't described in the code (for example **GET**: _/ users_), we will receive a 404 response. In order to write something like this on nodes, we would need about 200 lines of code. Impressive, right? Let's move on.

**Express.js** extends common Node objects [request](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/http.html#class-httpclientrequest) and [response](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/http.html#class-httpserverresponse), adding a lot of useful features right out of the box. For example, it parses _query-parameters_ into an object and can take parts of a URL as parameters. In _response_ there are convenient methods to format response data:
<SnippetJS04 />

5 lines, and how many benefits! This is how Express.js conquered the world. Currently, there are a huge number of npm packages for express, designed to solve various cases. Let's consider one of these - parsing the body of the query. Earlier to do this, we would need to add a package (officially recognized Best Practice) [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser). But since it was widely used,  the methods from it has been re-added under the express methods to provide request body parsing support out-of-the-box. 
<div className="details">

    Take a look at logs:

    <img src={express_body_logImg} alt="express_body_log" />

We explored enough basic **express** functionality to start with, so now we can take a look at how all this code would be scaled in real life.

And the best part 🍎. Here we will talk about the structure of the project, what, where, and why. For a quick start of a project, we can use [express-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator), which is created by the Express team and generates a default starter on **Express.js**. It should be installed globally to be accessible anywhere from any project. To do this, add the `-g` flag to the installation command:

Pay attention to the `scripts` field in _package.json_, which contains npm scripts for working with the application. In order to start the server, we will need to use the command `npm start`.

Currently, our project implements only one layer - **routes**, which should be responsible **ONLY** for working with HTTP-requests.

<div className="bubble small subtle">

Why so radical? _...should be responsible **ONLY** for working..._. Proper layering of the application is a guarantee of code that will be easy to maintain due to the convenient development and clear structure. If the layer only works with HTTP requests, then there should be no business logic or data handling, and vice versa.

</div>

Let's make our server smart and give it <span className="tooltip" data-tooltip="🕵️ 007 🔫"><u>logic, business logic</u></span>. In the world of Express applications, the layer that is responsible for business logic is called  **services**, and because it is not generated automatically, we will create it manually.

<div className="details">
  <input type="checkbox" id="accordion-6-5" />
  <label className="summary" htmlFor="accordion-6-5">
    <strong>Creating and testing the services layer</strong>
  </label>
  <div className="details-body">


    1. Create a folder _/services_  
    2. Create a file _/services/user.service.js_  
    3. Add a function to the file and export it:

    <SnippetJS08 />

    4 Import the function from the service to the router, use it to get a user's name.

    <SnippetJS09 />

    5. Run the server `npm start`  
    6. Send POST-request to the _/users_ route and take a look at the response that contains the sent name

    <img src={service_testImg} alt="service_test" />
  </div>
</div>

Now the server is able to do something, time to think about how we want to store data! There is a **repositories** layer for this, and we are going to implement it.

    2. Create file _/repositories/user.repository.js_  
    3. Add a function to the file and export it:

    <SnippetJS10 />

    <div className="bubble small subtle">

      We won't deal with a database in this lecture, so our code is just a simulation of working with it. In reality, this layer should contain all the work with data: their retrieval, saving, and updating.

    </div>

    4. Import the function from the repository into the service and add the function `saveName ()`:

    <SnippetJS11 />

    5. Import the function from the service into the router and use it to work with the request body:
    <SnippetJS12 />
    6. Run the server `npm start`  
    7. Send POST-request to the _/users_ route and take a look at the response "Data is saved"

    <img src={repository_testImg} alt="repository_test" />
  </div>
</div>

And the last layer is **middlewares**, examples of which we have already seen in this project. Let's find out how it is configured and what it does.

<div className="details">
  <input type="checkbox" id="accordion-6-7" />
  <label className="summary" htmlFor="accordion-6-7">

  </label>
  <div className="details-body">


    1. Create folder _/middlewares_  
    2. Create file _/middlewares/auth.middleware.js_  
    3. Add a function to the file and export it:

    <SnippetJS13 />


    <div className="bubble small subtle">

      **middlewares** - perform some actions on data coming through them and then they either pass the data to the next function in a stack or they end the request-response cycle. The middleware function takes three arguments: (req, res, next). We are already familiar with the first two objects, and the third is the callback function, which informs that all current operations are complete and we can proceed to the next step.

    </div>


    4. Import the middleware to the router and use it to secure the GET route:
    
    <SnippetJS14 />

    <div className="bubble small subtle">

      To initialize the middleware, you can use the `app.use` syntax, or simply pass it as a second argument to router.

    </div>

    5. Run the server `npm start`  
    6. Send GET-request to the _/users_ route with the header `Authorization: user` and take a look at response - 401 status

      <img src={middleware_test1Img} alt="middleware_test1" />

    7. Send GET-request to the _/users_ route with the header `Authorization: admin` and take a look at response - we passed the check

    <img src={middleware_test2Img} alt="middleware_test2" />
  </div>
</div>

And that's it, we covered the basics of Node.js applications structure. Now you're a true full-stack 😎

That's it, congratulations! The lecture is completely scrolled, you don't need to read anything else. Quickly go to the tabs you opened during the lecture and read more. Then give yourself a break. At least half an hour... Yes, deadlines and all that, but it will be a bit more effective if you give yourself a break to think everything through, and then go back and do your homework.

I was told that you all know how to deploy client applications, so why not learn to deploy Node.js servers?

  Here is a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs?singlepage=true">link to the official <strong>Heroku</strong> tutorial</a> - take a look and try. You may also want to deploy your homework 😉
